  # py/log-injection is mitigated at the logging infrastructure level via
  # LogInjectionFilter (app/core/logging.py), which strips control characters
  # (\r, \n, \x00) from every log record before emission.  The highest-risk
  # unauthenticated call site (email.py) is also sanitized explicitly.
  # All remaining flagged call sites are behind authentication/RBAC.
